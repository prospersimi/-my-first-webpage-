    <p>The argument in favor of 2 spaces is that it takes up less space in your code editor - which can be especially
        useful on a laptop's smaller screen. There is more room for your code - and you'll be staring at less blank
        space. When a file has many levels of nesting (as you might see in a longer HTML document), your code won't run
        off the screen as much.</p>
